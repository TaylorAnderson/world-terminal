  messages:
  - Hello user.
  - I am writing to you from the end of the world.
  - I'm afraid things have not gone according to plan.
  - 'The device you have found is not a computer.  Not exactly. '
  - 'It is a piece of technology I have designed.  '
  - It gives the user the ability to remotely interact with a snapshot of reality,
    frozen in time.
  - It is designed as a terminal to tightly control user interaction with a snapshot.  This
    prevents accidental alteration of the timeline.
  - This device is damaged.
  - I'm afraid my experiments have caused parts of it to split from the whole, and
    scatter themselves across space-time.
  - This is why I have sent this message to you, user.
  - (Sorry for overwriting your input, by the way; this device was not built to display
    messages like this.  I had to...find a workaround.)
  - I need you to recover the parts of this device that have been lost.
  - I have, I believe, roughly pinned them down to three locations.
  - When the device enters these locations, it will be doing so in read-only mode.  I
    see no reason to let you modify the snapshots.
  - 'When you find the piece of the device, I will enable edit mode for ten seconds,
    during which you will instruct the device to retrieve the piece. After that, the
    device will automatically exit the snapshot. '
  - Do not fail, user.  I am counting on you.
